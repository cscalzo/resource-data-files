### A Collection of Helpful Data in Various Formats

I have started this project as a central location for data sources that I find myself using in projects from time to time. I will continue to add to this and will try to cite the the sources for the data below. The data stored here will be in various formats based the needs that I had for a project. I may introduce new formats of data that i have already included in different formats as time/projects needs require it.
